4. **Interactive Elements**:
    - Ability to drag and drop appointments for easy rescheduling.
    - Options to resize appointments to adjust their time duration.
    - Simple resource reassignment for any appointment via the sidebar.
5. **Dynamic Timeline**: The timeline adapts according to the selected view mode, showing appropriate time divisions (hours, days, months).
